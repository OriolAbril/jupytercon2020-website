                We believe that implementing some environmentally-friendly practices can have a <strong>positive impact</strong> and generate sustainable solutions.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Efforts To Reduce Environmental Footprint</h2>
            
                <h3>Some of the things we do</h3>

	                <p>
	                    JupyterCon 2020 is working towards having a limited impact on the environment through careful consumption of energy and resources.
	                </p>

	                <p>
	                    This includes, among others, electronically circulating meeting materials (online file sharing), not producing unnecessary conference material and products, choosing environmentally-friendly and socially-friendly products, as well as providing healthy food and hosting meetings and social events in central locations.
	                </p>

	                <p>
	                    These guidelines are provided for coordinators, committees and contractors to the conference and aim to educate and inspire a continued mitigation of environmental footprint.
	                </p>

                <h3>Some of the things you can do as a visitor</h3>

	                <ul>
	                    <li>
	                    Choose walking! The venue is located in the city center, all hotels and social venues are located by walking distance from each other â€“ walk and explore the city, use the public transportations or the city bikes instead of taking taxis.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Please follow the waste separation instructions at the venue and at your accommodations when available.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Berlin tap water is of very high quality. Tap water stations will be available throughout the venue. Bring your own bottles and fill them up with tap water.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
